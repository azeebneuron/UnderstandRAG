# HELLO TEAMMATES!! 

So you all must have heard fine tooning and RAG. Let me tell you sounds easy but is not. SO FOCUSSS!!

Let's start by understanding what we'll be needing for our SE project.

## 1. RAG vs Fine-tuning Analysis

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid RAG-First Strategy
- **Primary: Implement RAG first**
  - Better suited for course-specific assistance (requirement 1.2)
  - More flexible for handling varying course content
  - Faster to implement and iterate
  - Lower computational and maintenance costs
  - Can be enhanced with fine-tuning later

- **Secondary: Selective Fine-tuning**
  - Reserved for specific components like **academic integrity filtering**
  - Used for standardizing response formats
  - Implemented after RAG system proves successful

### Technical Stack Recommendations
1. **Base LLM Options**
   - Mixtral 8x7B (open source, powerful, free for commercial use)
   - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B
   
2. **Vector Database**
   - Milvus (open source, scalable)
   - Qdrant (good balance of features and ease of use)
   - Pinecone

3. **RAG Framework**
   - LangChain (comprehensive toolkit)
   - LlamaIndex (specialized for RAG)

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core RAG System
1. Document Processing Pipeline
   - Course material ingestion
   - Chunking strategy
   - Metadata extraction
   
2. Vector Store Setup
   - Database configuration
   - Indexing pipeline
   - Query optimization

3. Response Generation
   - Context retrieval
   - Answer synthesis
   - Academic integrity filtering

### Phase 2: User Interface & Integration
1. API Development
2. Frontend Components
3. Authentication Integration

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Feedback (Weeks 9-12)
1. Analytics Pipeline
2. Feedback Collection
3. Performance Optimization


## 5. Success Metrics

1. **Technical Metrics**
   - Response accuracy > 90%
   - Query latency < 2 seconds

2. **User Metrics**
   - Student satisfaction > 85%
   - Query resolution rate > 90%
   - Resource relevance score > 4/5

Greatt! If you didn't understand, No issues. Let's abstract things a little [RAG Simplified](RAGsimplified.md)
